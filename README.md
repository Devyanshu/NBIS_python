## NBIS using Python

### Python scripts to carry out some tasks using NBIS on FVC databases.

#### minutiae_dtct.py

This Python file generates the .xyt files from the given .jpeg or .wsq image,
in addition to the .xyt files, the mindtct, program of [NBIS](https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/nist-biometric-image-software-nbis) also generates
other formats, which can be removed using a seperate Python file named
'delete_files.py'. Provide the path of the directory containing the images
and path of the directory to store the files generated by the mindtct program.
Make sure that mindtct in available on your path for this code to work
correctly, if your don't want to add mindtct to yout path, provide the path in the file.
##### Usage
`python minutiae_dtct.py -p <path to image files> -s <location to save>`

#### generate_partial_fp.py

This Python file will generate partial fingerprints of size 150x150
from the images of a given directory.
Partial fingerprints will be generated with a 50% overlap, to change this,
change the value of overlap variable, in fractions. Provide a path to the
original image directory and a path to location to save the images.
The partial images are saved with the same name as the original image
follwed by RxC, where R is the row from which the partial image is created
and C is the column. For more detail see [here](https://github.com/Devyanshu/image-split-with-overlap).
##### Usage
`python generate_partial_fp.py -p <path to full image files> -s <location to save>`

##### Sample Image
![Sample Image](/images/102_1.jpg)
###### Image : FVC 2002 DB1 Part B, 102_1.tif
